The current R project includes the code for calculating the Seasonality Coefficient based on night lights as described in Stathakis & Baltas (2018) <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

The calculation of Seasonality Coefficient for [NUTS 3](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/GISCO/distribution/v2/nuts/download/ref-nuts-2016-01m.shp.zip) and [LAU](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/GISCO/geodatafiles/LAU-2018-01M-SH.zip) is provided.

The results are exported to the *output* directory .


Snpp-VIIRS monthly night lights <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> are used for 2014, 2015, 2016. 
Preprocessing has been done on the basis of the DMSP / OLS night lights and the methodology described in the relevant repository  [repository](https://github.com/kokkytos/viirs-global-mosaic).

The complete environment in which the current R code was executed is described in the file [sessionInfo.txt](sessionInfo.txt)
